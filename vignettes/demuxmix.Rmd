# Introduction

Droplet-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitates measuring the
transcriptomes of thousands of cells in a single run. Pooling cells from
different samples or conditions before cell partitioning and library
preparation can significantly lower costs and reduce batch effects. The task of
assigning each cell of a pooled sample to its sample of origin is called
demultiplexing. If genetically diverse samples are pooled, single nucleotide
polymorphisms in coding regions can be used for demultiplexing. When working
with genetically similar or identical samples, an additional experimental step
is required to label the cells with a sample-specific barcode oligonucleotide
before pooling. Several techniques have been developed to label cells or nuclei
with oligonucleotides based on antibodies [@stoeckius; @gaublomme] or lipids
[@mcginnis]. These oligonucleotides are termed hashtag oligonucleotides (HTOs)
and are sequenced together with the RNA molecules of the cells resulting in an
(HTOs x droplets) count matrix in addition to the (genes x droplets) matrix
with RNA read counts.

The *demuxmix* package implements a method to demultiplex droplets based on HTO
counts using negative binomial regression mixture models. *demuxmix* can be
applied to the HTO counts only, but better results are often achieved if the
total number of genes detected per droplet (not the complete transcription
profile) is passed to the method along with the HTO counts to leverage the
positive association between genes detected and HTO counts. Further, *demuxmix*
provides estimated error rates based on its probabilistic mixture model
framework, plots for data quality assessment, and multiplet identification, as
outlined in the example workflows in this vignette. Technical details of the
methods are described in the man pages.


# Installation

The *demuxmix* package is available at [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org)
and can be installed via *BiocManager::install*:
```{r installation.install, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("demuxmix")
```
The package only needs to be installed once. Load the package into an R
session with
```{r installation.loadlib, eval = FALSE}
library(demuxmix)
```


# Quick start

A matrix of raw HTO counts (HTO x cells) and a vector with the number of
detected genes per droplet are needed to run *demuxmix* with default settings.
Empty and low-quality droplets should be removed before running *demuxmix*.
A gene with at least one read is usually considered as detected.
Here, we simulate a small example dataset.
```{r quickstart.simulate}
library(demuxmix)
set.seed(2642)
class <- rbind(c(rep(TRUE, 220), rep(FALSE, 200)),
               c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep(TRUE, 220)))
simdata <- dmmSimulateHto(class=class, mu=c(150, 300), theta=c(15, 20),
                          muAmbient=c(30, 30), thetaAmbient=c(10, 10),
                          muRna=3000, thetaRna=30)
hto <- simdata$hto
dim(hto)
rna <- simdata$rna
length(rna) == ncol(hto)
```
The dataset consists of 420 droplets with cells labeled with two different HTOs.
The first 200 droplets are singlets labeled with the first HTO followed by
another 200 singlets labeled with the second HTO. The remaining 20 droplets are
doublets, which are positive for both HTOs. Next, we run *demuxmix* to assign
droplets to HTOs.
```{r quickstart.demuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=rna)
summary(dmm)
classes <- dmmClassify(dmm)
table(classes$HTO)
```
The object *dmm* contains the mixture models used to classify the droplets. The
data frame returned  by *summary* shows that `r sum(classes$HTO == "HTO_1")`
droplets were assigned to *HTO_1* and `r sum(classes$HTO == "HTO_2")` to
*HTO_2*, respectively. Since these results meet our expectations and
the estimated error rates are reasonably low, we ran *dmmClassify* to obtain
the classifications for each droplet as a data frame with one row per droplet.
The first column *HTO* of this data frame contains the classification results
which are usually used to extract the singlets for downstream analysis.

As additional quick quality control, a histogram of the HTO values overlayed
with the components from the mixture model can be plotted. The following
command plots a panel with one histogram per HTO in the dataset.
```{r quickstart.histogram}
plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
```
In this example, the mixture models for both HTOs fit well. *HTO_2* shows an
even better separation of positive (tagged) and negative (non-tagged) droplets.
A large overlap of the blue and red component would be concerning.


# Demultiplexing droplets with demuxmix

## Example datasets

Two example datasets are introduced in this vignette to illustrate a typical
*demuxmix* workflow. The first dataset is a small simulated dataset that was
used to generate the plots when building this vignette. The alternative second
dataset is a real dataset and can be downloaded from the *ExperimentHub* via the
*scRNAseq* package. Both datasets can be used to go through this vignette by
running either the first (simulated data) or the second code block (real data)
below. Since the real dataset is much larger, some commands may take up to one
minute to complete, which is the reason why the simulated data was used to
build this vignette.


### Simulated dataset

Simulated HTO count data are generated for 650 droplets by the method
*dmmSimulateHto*. The logical matrix *class* defines for each droplet (column)
and HTO (row) whether the droplet is positive or negative for that
HTO. Thus, the 3 x 650 matrix *class* below describes a dataset with 3
hashtags and 650 droplets, of which 50 are doublets (with cells tagged
by *HTO_1* and *HTO_2*). The remaining 600 droplets consist of 3 blocks of 200
singlets positive for one of the three HTOs each.

```{r simulate, fig.height=4}
library(demuxmix)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

set.seed(563425)
class <- rbind(
    c(rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 50)),
    c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 50)),
    c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 50)))
simdata <- dmmSimulateHto(class)
hto <- simdata$hto
rna <- simdata$rna

hto1 <- data.frame(HTO_1=hto[1, ], HTO=colSums(hto), NumGenes=rna)
pa <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=HTO_1)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)
pb <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=NumGenes, y=HTO)) + geom_point()
plot_grid(pa, pb, labels=c("A", "B"))
```
*dmmSimulateHto* returns a matrix with the simulated HTO counts as well as a
vector with a simulated number of detected genes for each droplet. The
histogram in panel A depicts the distribution of the first hashtag. The
scatterplot in panel B shows that the method simulates a positive
association between the number of detected genes and the number of HTO counts
per droplet, which is often observed in real data.


### Cell line mixture dataset

The cell line mixture dataset from @stoeckius consists of cells from 4 different
cell lines. Three samples were taken from each cell line and tagged with a
different HTO resulting in a total of 12 different HTOs. The downloaded dataset
still contains many potentially empty droplets, which are removed using
*emptyDrops*. Subsequently, the numbers of detected genes are calculated and
the HTO matrix is extracted from the SingleCellExperiment object. More
information about the preprocessing and data structures for single-cell data in
R/Bioconductor can be found in this excellent
[online book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/index.html).

```{r stoeckius, eval=FALSE}
library(demuxmix)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(scRNAseq)
library(DropletUtils)

htoExp <- StoeckiusHashingData(type="mixed")
eDrops <- emptyDrops(counts(htoExp))
htoExp <- htoExp[, which(eDrops$FDR <= 0.001)]

rna <- apply(assay(htoExp) > 0, 2, sum)
hto <- assay(altExp(htoExp))
dim(hto)

hto1 <- data.frame(HEK_A=hto["HEK_A", ], KG1_C=hto["KG1_C", ],
                   HTO=colSums(hto), NumGenes=rna)
pa <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=HEK_A)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 500))
pb <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=KG1_C)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10) +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0, 1000), ylim=c(0, 500))
pc <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=NumGenes, y=HTO)) + geom_point(size=0.1) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 750))
plot_grid(pa, pb, pc, labels=c("A", "B", "C"))
```

The plots generated by the code above reveal that the quality of the different
HTOs vary in the cell line mixture dataset. Most HTOs, like *HEK_A*, show a
nicely separated bimodal distribution, but others, like *HG1_C*, demonstrate a
larger overlap of the distributions for the positive and negative droplets.
As with the simulated data, there is a positive association between HTO counts
and detected number of genes. The association appears to be noisier, however.
The reason therefore is that four different cell lines with distinct RNA
profiles and different cell characteristics likely influencing antibody binding
were pooled. Consequently, the HTO counts and the number of detected genes
are very different between cells from different samples, but very similar
between cells from the same sample. This rather uncommon pooling design makes it
difficult to leverage the association between number of genes detected
and HTO counts to improve demultiplexing. With default parameters, *demuxmix*
automatically selects the most appropriate model, and, for this dataset, naive
instead of regression mixture models are used for most HTOs.


## Running demuxmix

*demuxmix* takes a matrix of HTO counts and a vector with the numbers of
detected genes per droplet as input and returns an object of class *Demuxmix*
containing a mixture model for each HTO. Several additional parameters can be
passed to *demuxmix*, but all these parameters have default values which work
well across a large range of datasets. With the default settings,
*demuxmix* selects either naive mixture models or regression mixture models for
each HTO depending on which model provides the best separation between positive
and negative droplets.

```{r demuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=rna)
dmm

classLabels <- dmmClassify(dmm)
head(classLabels)

summary(dmm)

# Compare demultiplexing results to ground truth from simulation
table(classLabels$HTO, simdata$groundTruth)
```

For the simulated data, the object *dmm* contains three regression mixture
models. We then apply *dmmClassify* to obtain a data frame with one row for
each droplet. The first column contains the classification result. The second
column contains the posterior probability that the assigned HTO is correct.
The last column contains the type of the assignment, which is either
"singlet", "multiplet", "negative" (not tagged by any HTO), or "uncertain"
(posterior probability too small to classify the droplet with confidence). Only
droplets of type singlet should be kept in the dataset. Multiplets of two or
more cells from the same sample cannot be detected at the demultiplexing step.
The comparison with the true labels from the simulation shows that most
droplets were classified correctly.

The parameter *model* can be used to select a specific mixture model. The naive
mixture model selected in the code below does not use any information from the
RNA data. As shown in the following output, the naive mixture model performs
slightly worse compared to the regression mixture model mainly because more
droplets are assigned to the class "uncertain".

```{r demuxmixNaive}
dmmNaive <- demuxmix(hto, model="naive")
dmmNaive

classLabelsNaive <- dmmClassify(dmmNaive)
table(classLabelsNaive$HTO, classLabels$HTO)

table(simdata$groundTruth, classLabelsNaive$HTO)

summary(dmmNaive)
```

Another useful parameter is the acceptance probability *p.acpt*, which can be
passed to the *demuxmix* method to overwrite the default value, or
directly set on the object *dmm* as shown in the code block below. The parameter
is used at the classification step and specifies the minimum posterior
probability required to classify a droplet. If the posterior probability of the
most likely class is smaller than *p.acpt*, the cell is classified as
"uncertain". Setting *p.acpt* to 0 forces the classification of all droplets.
For HTO datasets of moderate quality, the default value can be lowered to
preserve more cells in the dataset. The *summary* method gives an estimation of
the FDR depending on the current setting of *p.acpt*.

```{r reclassify}
p.acpt(dmm)
p.acpt(dmm) <- 0.95
summary(dmm)

p.acpt(dmm) <- 0
summary(dmm)

table(dmmClassify(dmm)$HTO)
```


## Quality control

The *demuxmix* package implements methods for assessing data quality and
model fit. All plotting methods plot a panel with one graph for each HTO in the
dataset as default. Specific HTOs can be selected via the parameter *hto*. The
most informative plot is probably the histogram of the HTO data overlaid
with the mixture probability mass function:

```{r qualityHistogram, fig.height=8}
plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
dmmOverlap(dmm)
```

In our example dataset, all three HTOs show a good separation between negative
droplets (blue component) and positive droplets (red component) and all three
mixture models demonstrate a good model fit. For HTO datasets with a large
sequencing depth, the x axis can range from 0 up to many thousand reads
so that the red component appears as a flat line along the x axis. In that
case, the *ggplot2* method *coord_cartesian* can be used to zoom into the
interesting area of the plot where the two components intersect
(see examples in the help page of *plotDmmHistogram*).

A distinct quality measure related to the histogram is the area intersected by
the two components of the mixture model, which is calculated by *dmmOverlap*.
Good HTO experiments usually results in values less than 0.03.

Another useful quality plot is the histogram of the posterior probability that a
droplet is positive for the respective hashtag:

```{r qualityPosteriorP, fig.height=8}
plotDmmPosteriorP(dmm)
```

As in the histogram of the example dataset, most posterior probabilities should
be either close to 0 (negative droplet) for close to 1 (positive droplet) with
only very few probabilities in between (uncertain).

Finally, if regression mixture models were used, the relation between the
number of detected genes and the HTO counts can be plotted:

```{r qualityScatterplot, fig.height=8}
plotDmmScatter(dmm)
```

The color of the dots indicates the posterior probability of the droplets being
positive for the HTO. A droplet with many detected genes is required to have
more HTO reads in order to be classified as positive. If naive mixture models
were used, the dashed decision boundaries between blue (negative) and red
(positive) droplets would be vertical lines.


# Special usecase: pooling unlabeled with labeled cells

If precious rare cells are pooled with highly abundant cells, labeling only
the highly abundant cells but not the rare cells avoids additional losses of
the rare cells during the labeling process. However, such a design results in a
more challenging demultiplexing task. The real dataset used as example in this
section consists of rare cerebrospinal fluid cells (unlabeled) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were stained with
oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies. In this design, the "negative"
cells identified by demuxmix correspond to the CSF cells. The dataset is
included in the *demuxmix* package as data frame.

```{r csfLoad}
data(csf)
head(csf)

csf <- csf[csf$NumGenes >= 200, ]
nrow(csf)
hto <- t(matrix(csf$HTO, dimnames=list(rownames(csf), "HTO")))
```

The data frame contains the number of HTO read and the number of detected genes
per droplet in the first two columns. We remove all droplets with less than 200
detected genes, since these droplets unlikely contain intact cells. The HTO
counts are then converted into a matrix as required by *demuxmix*. The matrix
has only one row since only the PBMCs were stained. For this example dataset,
CSF cells and PBMCs from two genetically unrelated donors were pooled so that
genetic demultiplexing can be used to benchmark the HTO-based demultiplexing.
The third column contains the result from the genetic demultiplexing using
freemuxlet [@kang]. The fourth column contains freemuxlet's logarithmized
posterior probability.

```{r csfDemuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=csf$NumGenes)
dmm

summary(dmm)

dmmOverlap(dmm)
```

*demuxmix* selected a regression mixture model with a significant
regression coefficient in the positive component indicating that the number of
detected genes in the stained PBMCs is predictive for the HTO counts observed
in these cells. Although *demuxmix* selected a regression model for the
negative component as well, the smaller coefficient and the larger p value
suggest that the association is much weaker in the CSF cells. This is common
since a larger amount of background HTOs is required in order to detect the
association in the negative droplets.

Next, we look at QC plots:

```{r csfPlots, fig.height=7}
histo <- plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
scatter <- plotDmmScatter(dmm) + coord_cartesian(xlim=c(2, 4))
plot_grid(histo, scatter, labels=c("A", "B"), nrow=2)
```

The histogram reveals a good model fit but also shows some background staining
of the CSF cells. The mean of the negative component is
`r round(demuxmix:::getMu1(dmm@models[["HTO"]], standardize=TRUE), digits=1)`
reads. Still, the overlap with the positive component (mean of
`r round(demuxmix:::getMu2(dmm@models[["HTO"]], standardize=TRUE), digits=1)`
reads) is reasonably small and the larger mean of the negative component is
probably driven partly by the large sequencing depth of the HTO library. The
scatter plot shows that a smaller set of cells has a lower RNA content (y axis)
and that those cells require less HTO counts (x axis) in order to be classified
as positive (red color).

Finally, we use the genetic demultiplexing to assess *demuxmix's* performance.
Multi-sample multiplets detected by freemuxlet are removed since multiplets
cannot be detected when just one of two samples was stained. We also
remove cells which were not classified with high confidence by freemuxlet.
```{r csfBenchmark}
class <- dmmClassify(dmm)
highConf <- csf$freemuxlet %in% c("0,0", "1,1") &
    exp(csf$freemuxlet.prob) >= 0.99
table(class$HTO[highConf], csf$freemuxlet[highConf])

# Sensitivity "P(class=PBMC | PBMC)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] == "HTO") /
    sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")

# Specificity "P(class=CSF | CSF)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] == "negative") /
    sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")
```

With the default acceptance probability of 0.9, *demuxmix* achieved a
sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Only
`r sum(class$HTO[highConf] == "uncertain")` cells are classified as "uncertain"
and have to be discarded.

For comparison, we run *demuxmix* again and this time manually select the
naive mixture model.

```{r csfBenchmarkNaive}
dmmNaive <- demuxmix(hto, model="naive")
class <- dmmClassify(dmmNaive)
table(class$HTO[highConf], csf$freemuxlet[highConf])

# Sensitivity "P(class=PBMC | PBMC)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] == "HTO") /
    sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")

# Specificity "P(class=CSF | CSF)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] == "negative") /
    sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")
```

Compared to the regression mixture model, the naive model achieved a slightly
lower sensitivity and specificity, and, in addition, more cells were classified
as "uncertain" demonstrating the benefit of modeling the relationship between
number of detected genes and HTO counts.
