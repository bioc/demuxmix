# Introduction

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been frequently used in
biomedical research to interrogate the transcriptomes of several thousands
of cells. Pooling cells from different samples or treatments prior to cell
partitioning and library preparation can reduce costs and batch
effects significantly. The task of assigning each cell of a pooled sample to
its original sample is called demultiplexing. If genetically divers samples
are pooled, single nucleotide polymorphisms in coding regions can be used for
demultiplexing. For genetically similar or identical samples, an additional
experimental step is required to label the cells with a sample-specific
oligonucleotide (barcode) before pooling. Techniques have been developed to
label cells or nuclei based on antibodies [@stoeckius; @gaublomme].
Alternatively, lipids can be used instead of  antibodies [@mcginnis]. These
methods have in common that they label the cells with oligonucleotides, termed
hashtag oligonucleotides (HTOs), which are sequenced along with the RNA
molecules of the cells resulting in an (HTO x cells) count matrix in addition
to the (genes x cells) matrix with RNA read counts.

The *demuxmix* package implements a method to demultiplex cells based on HTO
counts using negative binomial mixture models. *demuxmix* can be applied to the
HTO counts only, but better results are often achieved if the total number
of genes detected per cell (not the full transcription profile) is passed
to the method along with the HTO counts to leverage the positive association
between genes detected and HTO counts. Further, *demuxmix* provides estimated
error rates based on its probabilistic mixture model framework, plots for data
quality assessment, and multiplet identification as outlined in the example
workflows in this vignette. Technical details of the methods are described in
the man pages.


# Quick start

A matrix of raw HTO counts (HTO x cells) and a vector with the number of
detected genes per cell are needed to run *demuxmix* with default settings.
Empty and low-quality droplets should be removed before running *demuxmix*.
A gene with at least one read is usually considered as detected.
Here, we quickly simulate a small example dataset.
```{r quickstart.simulate}
library(demuxmix)
set.seed(2642)
class <- rbind(c(rep(TRUE, 220), rep(FALSE, 200)),
               c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep(TRUE, 220)))
simdata <- dmmSimulateHto(class=class, mu=c(150, 300), theta=c(15, 20),
                          muAmbient=c(30, 30), thetaAmbient=c(10, 10),
                          muRna=3000, thetaRna=30)
hto <- simdata$hto
dim(hto)
rna <- simdata$rna
length(rna) == ncol(hto)
```
The dataset consists of two different HTOs which were simulated to label 200
cells each. The dataset also contains an additional 20 doublets tagged by both
HTOs. Next, we run *demuxmix* to assign hashtags to cells.
```{r quickstart.demuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=rna)
summary(dmm)
classes <- dmmClassify(dmm)
table(classes$HTO)
```
The object *dmm* contains the mixture models used to classify the cells. The
data frame returned  by *summary* shows that `r sum(classes$HTO == "HTO_1")`
cells were assigned to *HTO_1* and `r sum(classes$HTO == "HTO_2")` to *HTO_2*
respectively. Since these results meet our expectations and
the estimated error rates are reasonably low, we ran *dmmClassify* to obtain
the classifications for each cell as a data frame with one row per cell.
The first column *HTO* of this data frame contains the classification results
which are usually used to extract the singletons for downstream analysis.

As additional quick quality control, a histogram of the HTO values overlayed
with the components from the mixture model can be plotted. The following
command plots a panel with one histogram per HTO in the dataset.
```{r quickstart.histogram}
plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
```
In this example, the mixture models for both HTOs fit well. *HTO_2* shows an
even better separation of positive (tagged) and negative (non-tagged) cells. A
large overlap of the blue and red component would be concerning.


# Demultiplexing cells with demuxmix

## Example datasets

Two example datasets are introduced in this vignette to illustrate a typical
*demuxmix* workflow. The first dataset is a small simulated dataset that was
used to generate the plots when building this vignette. The alternative second
dataset is a real dataset and can be downloaded from the *ExperimentHub* via the
*scRNAseq* package. Both datasets can be used to go through this vignette by
running either the first (simulated data) or the second code block (real data)
below. Since the real dataset is much larger, some commands may take up to one
minute to complete, which is the reason why the simulated data was used to
build this vignette.


### Simulated data

Simulated HTO count data are generated for 650 cells by the method
*dmmSimulateHto*. The logical matrix *class* defines for each cell (column) and
hashtag (row) whether the cell is positive (tagged) or negative for that
hashtag. Thus, the 3 x 650 matrix *class* below describes a dataset with 3
hashtags and 650 cells of which 50 cells are doublets (*HTO_1* and *HTO_2*).
The remaining 600 cells consist of 200 singletons from each of the
three hashtags. 

```{r simulate, fig.height=4}
library(demuxmix)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)

set.seed(563425)
class <- rbind(
  c(rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 50)),
  c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 50)),
  c(rep(FALSE, 200), rep(FALSE, 200), rep( TRUE, 200), rep(FALSE, 50)))
simdata <- dmmSimulateHto(class)
hto <- simdata$hto
rna <- simdata$rna

hto1 <- data.frame(HTO_1=hto[1, ], HTO=colSums(hto), NumGenes=rna)
pa <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=HTO_1)) + geom_histogram(bins=30)
pb <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=NumGenes, y=HTO)) + geom_point()
plot_grid(pa, pb, labels=c("A", "B"))
```
*dmmSimulateHto* returns a matrix with the simulated HTO counts as well as a
vector with a simulated number of detected genes for each cell. As depicted in
the histogram for the first hashtag, the separation is fairly good but not
perfect. The scatterplot in panel B shows that the method simulates a positive
association between the number of detected genes and the number of HTO counts
per cell, which is often observed in real data.


### Cell hashing data from Stoeckius et al.

The dataset from @stoeckius consists of cells from 4 different cell
lines. Three samples were taken from each cell line and tagged with a different
HTO resulting in a total of 12 different HTOs. The downloaded dataset still
contains many potentially empty droplets, which are removed using *emptyDrops*.
Subsequently, the numbers of detected genes are calculated and the HTO matrix
is extracted from the SingleCellExperiment object. More information about
the preprocessing and data structures for single cell data in R/Biocnductor
can be found in this excellent
[online book](http://bioconductor.org/books/release/OSCA/index.html).

```{r stoeckius, eval=FALSE}
library(demuxmix)
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
library(scRNAseq)
library(DropletUtils)

htoExp <- StoeckiusHashingData(type="mixed")
eDrops <- emptyDrops(counts(htoExp))
htoExp <- htoExp[, which(eDrops$FDR <= 0.001)]

rna <- apply(assay(htoExp) > 0, 2, sum)
hto <- assay(altExp(htoExp))
dim(hto)

hto1 <- data.frame(HEK_A=hto["HEK_A", ], KG1_C=hto["KG1_C", ],
                   HTO=colSums(hto), NumGenes=rna)
pa <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=HEK_A)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 500))
pb <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=KG1_C)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0, 1000), ylim=c(0, 500))
pc <- ggplot(hto1, aes(x=NumGenes, y=HTO)) + geom_point(size=0.1) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, 750))
plot_grid(pa, pb, pc, labels=c("A", "B", "C"))
```

The plots generated by the code above reveal that the quality of the different
HTOs vary in the data from Stoeckius et al. Most HTOs like *HEK_A* show a
nicely separated bimodal distribution, but others like *HG1_C* demonstrate a
larger overlap of the distributions from the tagged and non-tagged cells.
As with the simulated data, there is a positive association between HTO counts
and detected number of genes. The association appears to be noisier, however.
The reason therefore is that different cell lines with distinct RNA
profiles and different total amounts of RNA were pooled. Such a heterogeneous
pool of cells with very different RNA profiles is uncommon and makes it more
difficult to utilize the relation between RNA and HTO counts to improve
demultiplexing. In fact, *demuxmix* does not use the number of detected genes
for some HTOs in this dataset, if default settings are used.


## Running demuxmix

*demuxmix* takes a matrix of HTO counts and a vector with the numbers of
detected genes per cell as input and returns an object of class *Demuxmix*
containing a mixture model for each HTO. Several additional parameters can be
passed to *demuxmix*, but all these parameters have default values which work
for most datasets. With the default settings, *demuxmix* selects either naive
mixture models or regression mixture models for each HTO depending on which
model provides the best separation between tagged and non-tagged cells.

```{r demuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=rna)
dmm

classLabels <- dmmClassify(dmm)
head(classLabels)

summary(dmm)

# Compare demultiplexing results to ground truth from simulation
table(classLabels$HTO, simdata$groundTruth)
```

For the simulated data, the object *dmm* contains three regression mixture
models. We then apply *dmmClassify* to obtain a data frame with one row for
each cell. The first column contains the classification result. The second
column contains the posterior probability that the assigned hashtag is correct.
The last column contains the type of the assignment, which is either
"singleton", "multiplet", "negative" (not tagged by any HTO), or "uncertain"
(posterior probability too small to classify the cell with confidence). Only
cells of type singleton should be kept in the dataset. Multiplets of two or
more cells from the same sample cannot be detected at the demultiplexing step.
The comparison with the true cell labels from the simulation shows that most
cells were classified correctly.

The parameter *model* can be used to select a specific mixture model. The naive
mixture model selected in code below does not use any information from the RNA
data. The naive mixture model performs slightly worse compared to the
regression mixture model.

```{r demuxmixNaive}
dmmNaive <- demuxmix(hto, model="naive")
dmmNaive

classLabelsNaive <- dmmClassify(dmmNaive)
table(classLabelsNaive$HTO, classLabels$HTO)

table(simdata$groundTruth, classLabelsNaive$HTO)

summary(dmmNaive)
```

Another useful parameter is the acceptance probability *p.acpt*, which can be
passed to the *demuxmix* method to overwrite the default value, or
directly set on the object *dmm* as shown in the code block below. The parameter
is used at the classification step and specifies the minimum posterior
probability required to classify a cell. If the posterior probability of the
most likely class is smaller than *p.acpt*, the cell is classified as
"uncertain". Setting *p.acpt* to 0 forces the classification of all cells. For
HTO datasets of moderate quality, the default value can be lowered to preserve
more cells in the dataset. *summary* gives an estimation of the FDR
depending on the current setting of *p.acpt*.

```{r reclassify}
p.acpt(dmm)
p.acpt(dmm) <- 0.95
summary(dmm)

p.acpt(dmm) <- 0
summary(dmm)

table(dmmClassify(dmm)$HTO)
```


## Quality control

The *demuxmix* package implements methods for assessing data quality and
model fit. All plotting methods plot a panel with one graph for each HTO in the
dataset as default. Specific HTOs can be selected via the parameter *hto*. The
most informative plot is probably the histogram of the HTO data overlaid
with the mixture density:

```{r qualityHistogram, fig.height=8}
plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
dmmOverlap(dmm)
```

In our example dataset, all three HTOs show a good separation between non-tagged
cells (blue component) and tagged cells (red component) and all three mixture
models demonstrate a good model fit. For HTO datasets with a large
sequencing depth, the x axis can range from 0 up to many thousand reads
so that the red component appears as a flat line along the x axis. In that
case, the *ggplot2* method *coord_cartesian* can be used to zoom into the
interesting area of the plot where the two components intersect
(see examples in the help page of *plotDmmHistogram*).

A distinct quality measure related to the histogram is the area intersected by
the two components of the mixture model, which is be calculated by *dmmOverlap*.
Good HTO experiments usually results in values less than 0.03.

Another useful quality plot is the histogram of the posterior probability that a
cell is positive for the respective hashtag:

```{r qualityPosteriorP, fig.height=8}
plotDmmPosteriorP(dmm)
```

As in the histogram of the example dataset, most posterior probablities should
be either close to 0 (hashtag absent) for close to 1 (hashtag present) with
only very few probabilities in between (uncertain).

Finally, if regression mixture models were used, the relation between the
number of detected genes and the HTO reads can be plotted:

```{r qualityScatterplot, fig.height=8}
plotDmmScatter(dmm)
```

The color of the dots indicates the posterior probability of the cell being
tagged by the HTO. A cell with many detected genes is required to have more
HTO reads in order to be classified as positive. If naive mixture models were
used, the seperation between blue (negative) and red (positive) cells would be
a vertical line.


# Special usecase: pooling unlabeled with labeled cells

If precious rare cells are pooled with highly abundant cells, labeling only
the highly abundant cells (but not the rare cells) avoids additional cell
losses caused by the labeling process. However, such a design results in a
more challenging demultiplexing task. The real dataset used as example in this
section consists of rare cerebrospinal fluid cells (unlabeled) and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which were stained with
oligonucleotide-conjugated antibodies. In this special design, the "negative"
cells identified by demuxmix correspond to the CSF cells. The dataset is
included in the *demuxmix* package as data frame.

```{r csfLoad}
data(csf)
head(csf)

csf <- csf[csf$NumGenes >= 200, ]
nrow(csf)
hto <- t(matrix(csf$HTO, dimnames=list(rownames(csf), "HTO")))
```

The data frame contains the number of HTOs and the number of detected genes
per cell in the first two columns. We remove all droplets with less than 200
detected genes, since these droplets unlikely contain intact cells. The HTO
counts are then converted into a matrix as required by *demuxmix*. The matrix
has only one row since only the PBMCs were stained. For this example dataset,
CSF cells and PBMCs from two genetically unrelated donors were pooled so that
genetic demultiplexing can be used to benchmark the HTO-based demultiplexing.
The third column contains the result from the genetic demultiplexing using
freemuxlet (popscle). The fourth column contains the freemuxlet posterior
probability in logarithmic scale.

```{r csfDemuxmix}
dmm <- demuxmix(hto, rna=csf$NumGenes)
dmm

summary(dmm)

dmmOverlap(dmm)
```

*demuxmix* selected an regression mixture model with a highly significant
regression coefficient in the positive component indicating that the number of
detected genes in the stained PBMCs is predictive for the HTO counts observed
in these cells.

Next, we look at QC plots:

```{r csfPlots, fig.height=7}
histo <- plotDmmHistogram(dmm)
scatter <- plotDmmScatter(dmm)
plot_grid(histo, scatter, labels=c("A", "B"), nrow=2)
```

The histogram reveals a good model fit but also shows some background staining
of the CSF cells. The mean of the negative components is
`r round(demuxmix:::getMu1(dmm@models[["HTO"]], standardize=TRUE), digits=1)`
reads. Still, the overlap with the positive component (mean of
`r round(demuxmix:::getMu2(dmm@models[["HTO"]], standardize=TRUE), digits=1)`
reads) is reasonably small and the larger mean of the negative component is
probably driven partly by the large sequencing depth of the HTO library. The
scatter plots shows that there are still some cells with low RNA content and
that those cells require less HTO counts in order to be classified as positive.

Finally, we use the genetic demultiplexing to assess *demuxmix's* performance.
Doublets will be removed since doublets cannot be detected when just one of two
pooled samples was stained. We also remove cells which could not be classified
with high confidence based on genetics.
```{r csfBenchmark}
class <- dmmClassify(dmm)
highConf <- csf$freemuxlet %in% c("0,0", "1,1") &
  exp(csf$freemuxlet.prob) >= 0.99
table(class$HTO[highConf], csf$freemuxlet[highConf])

# Sensitivity "P(class=PBMC | PBMC)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] == "HTO") /
  sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")

# Specificity "P(class=CSF | CSF)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] == "negative") /
  sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")
```

With the default acceptance probability of 0.9, *demuxmix* achieved a
sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Only
`r sum(class$HTO[highConf] == "uncertain")` cells are classified as uncertain
and will have to be discarded.

For comparison, we run *demuxmix* again and this time manually select the
naive mixture model.

```{r csfBenchmarkNaive}
dmmNaive <- demuxmix(hto, model="naive")
class <- dmmClassify(dmmNaive)
table(class$HTO[highConf], csf$freemuxlet[highConf])

# Sensitivity "P(class=PBMC | PBMC)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] == "HTO") /
  sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "0,0" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")

# Specificity "P(class=CSF | CSF)"
sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] == "negative") /
  sum(csf$freemuxlet[highConf] == "1,1" & class$HTO[highConf] != "uncertain")
```

Compared to the regression mixture model, the naive model achieved a slightly
lower sensitivity and specificity, and, in addition, more cells were classified
as uncertain.
