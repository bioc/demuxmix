\title{Hashtag oligonucleotide (HTO) counts from 2,590 droplets}
\format{
A data frame with 2,590 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
  \item{HTO}{Number of HTO counts observed}
  \item{NumGenes}{Number of genes detected in the cell}
  \item{freemuxlet}{Genetic demultiplexing result}
  \item{freemuxlet.prob}{Posterior probability from genetic demultiplexing
    in logarithmic scale}
}

Raw sequencing data was aligned and processed using Cell Ranger 6.0.1. All
droplets that passed Cell Ranger's default filtering step were read in. Genes
with at least one read were considered as detected. Since Cell Ranger's
threshold to identify non-empty droplets is relatively lenient, some droplets
have as few as 30-50 genes detected. For most analyses, it is recommended
to remove droplets with less than about 200 detected genes
before demultiplexing.

data(csf)
}
\description{
Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were pooled and prepared for single-cell sequencing using the
10x Chromium System. Due to the low numbers of cells obtained from CSF, only
the PBMCs were stained using oligonucleotide-labeled antibodies
(BioLegend TotalSeq-A0257). CSF cells and PBMCs in this dataset were obtained
from two genetically diverse individuals so that genetic demultiplexing could
be used to validate the HTO-based demultiplexing. Genetic demultiplexing was
performed with freemuxlet, which is part of the popscle software package.
