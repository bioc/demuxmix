Title: Demultiplexing oligo-barcoded scRNA-seq data using regression mixture models
Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2023-01-26
Description: A package for demultiplexing single-cell sequencing experiments
    of pooled cells labeled with barcode oligonucleotides. The package
    implements methods to fit regression mixture models for a probabilistic
    classification of cells, including multiplet detection. Demultiplexing
    error rates can be estimated, and methods for quality control are provided.
