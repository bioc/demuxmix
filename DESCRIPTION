Title: Demultiplexing oligo-barcoded scRNA-seq data using regression mixture models
Version: 0.99.1
Date: 2022-07-22
Description: A package for demultiplexing single-cell sequencing experiments
    of pooled cells that were labeled with barcode oligonucleotides. The
    package implements methods to fit regression mixture models for a
    probabilistic classification of cells including the detection of
    multiplets. Demultiplexing error rates can be estimated and methods for
    quality control are provided.
