Title: Demultiplexing hashtagged cells using regression mixture models
Version: 0.1.7
Date: 2022-05-17
Description: A package for demultiplexing single-cell sequencing experiments
    of pooled cells that were labeled with barcode oligonucleotides. The
    package provides methods to fit mixture models for a probabilistic
    classification of the cells and to assess the quality and error rates of the
    demultiplexing.
